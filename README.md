1)What is the difference between the simple interest and compound interest on ₹8,000 at a rate of 10% per year for 2 years?

Step 1: Solve the Problem
calculate the simple interest (SI) and compound interest (CI) for the given problem.
Given:
Principal (P) = ₹8,000
Rate (R) = 10% per annum
Time (T) = 2 years

Calculate Simple Interest (SI)
Use the formula: SI=P×R×T/100
​SI=8000×10×2/100
​SI=80×10×2
SI=₹1,600

Calculate Compound Interest (CI)
Use the formula for Amount (A) first: A=P(1+R/100)^T
A=8000(1+10/100)^2
A=8000(110/100)^2
A=8000(1.1)^2 
A=8000×1.21
A=₹9,680

Now,calculate the Compound Interest: CI=A−P
CI=9680−8000
CI=₹1,680

Find the Difference
The difference between CI and SI is:
Difference = CI−SI
Difference = 1680−1600
Difference = ₹80

#PROBLEM-2
2)A principal of ₹10,000 is invested at a compound interest rate of 8% per year. What will be the total amount after 3 years?

Step 1: Solve the Problem
To find the total amount after 3 years, we'll use the compound interest formula:
A=P(1+R/100)^T
Given:
Principal (P) = ₹10,000
Rate (R) = 8% per year
Time (T) = 3 years

Calculation:
A=10000(1+8/100)^3
A=10000(1+0.08)^3 
A=10000(1.08)^3
A=10000×1.259712
A=12597.12
The total amount after 3 years will be ₹12,597.12.
